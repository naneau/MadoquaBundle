#MadoquaBundle

##Intro

MadoquaBundle is a very basic, markdown based blogging engine for Symfony2. It relies on a single directory with *.markdown files for its blog posts.

There's a simple service in Service/Post.php that describes the functionality.

##Dependencies

For the markdown parsing it relies on KNPLabs' MarkdownBundle @ http://github.com/knplabs/MarkdownBundle
